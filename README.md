# Quick Start Guide
This "hacked" version allows you to automatically unlock the "AllSuperRank" and "MultipleLang" secret trophies.

Just use [my deployment (hacked-github-stat-trophies.vercel.app)]() and follow the general instructions from [the original repo](https://github.com/ryo-ma/github-profile-trophy).

If you want to automatically gain some of the other trophies, configure these booleans in [src/card.ts](https://github.com/FlyN-Nick/hacked-github-stat-trophies/blob/VegaDeftwing-master/src/card.ts) (you'll have to deploy to Vercel yourself):
```
let wantAllSuperRank = true;
let wantMultipleLang = true;
let wantLongTimeAccount = false;
let wantAncientAccount = false;
let wantJoined2020 = false;
```
If you choose to use my deployement, it would be really appreciated if you gave me a star ðŸ™ƒ.
